       What is the FOIA?
    </button>
    <div id="b-a1" class="usa-accordion-content">
       <p>Since 1967, the Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA) has provided the public the right to request access to records from any  federal agency.&nbsp; It is often described as  the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. Federal  agencies are required to disclose any information requested under the FOIA unless  it falls under one of nine exemptions which protect interests such as personal  privacy, national security, and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The FOIA also requires agencies to proactively  post online certain categories of information, including frequently requested  records.&nbsp; As Congress, the President, and  the Supreme Court have all recognized, the FOIA is a vital part of our  democracy.</p>

          <p>FOIA.gov serves as  the government&rsquo;s comprehensive FOIA website for all information on the  FOIA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among many other features,  FOIA.gov provides a central resource for the public to understand the FOIA,  to locate records that are already available online, and to make a request for information that is not yet publicly available.&nbsp; FOIA.gov also promotes agency accountability  for the administration of the FOIA by graphically displaying the detailed  statistics contained in Annual FOIA Reports, so that they can be compared by  agency and over time.</p>

		  <p>Before making a request, first look to see if  the information you are interested in is already publicly available.&nbsp; You can find a lot of useful information on a  range of topics on each agency&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;  You can also search for information agencies have already posted online <a href="search.html">here on FOIA.gov</a>.</p>

                  <p>If the information you want is not publicly  available, you can submit a FOIA request to the agency&rsquo;s FOIA Office.&nbsp; The request simply must be in writing and reasonably  describe the records you seek.&nbsp; Most  federal agencies now accept FOIA requests electronically, including by web  form, e-mail or fax. &nbsp;See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/#agency-search">the list of federal  agencies</a> for details about how to make a request to each  agency and any specific requirements for seeking certain records.</p>

    <div id="b-a5" class="usa-accordion-content">
      <p>Each federal agency handles its own records in  response to requests. There are currently one hundred agencies subject to the  FOIA with several hundred offices that process FOIA requests.&nbsp; Your request will receive the quickest  possible response if it is addressed directly to the FOIA office of the agency or  agency component that you believe has the records you are seeking. See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/#agency-search">the list of federal  agencies</a> for the individual contact information for each  agency.</p>

      <p>A FOIA request can be made for any agency record. You can also specify the format in which you wish to receive the records (for example, printed or electronic form). The FOIA does not require agencies to create new records or to conduct research, analyze data, or answer questions when responding to requests.</p>

          <p>There is no central office  in the government that handles FOIA requests for all federal departments and  agencies. Each federal agency processes its own records in response to FOIA  requests. There are many different officials at these agencies who work hard  every day to make sure that the FOIA works. There are the FOIA professionals  who search for and process records in response to FOIA requests, FOIA Contacts and  FOIA Public Liaisons who work with FOIA requesters to answer questions and  resolve concerns, and Chief FOIA Officers who oversee their agency&rsquo;s compliance  with the FOIA.</p>

         <p>After an agency receives  your FOIA request, you will usually receive a letter acknowledging the request  with an assigned tracking number. If the agency requires additional information  before it can begin to process your request, it will contact you. The agency  will typically search for records in response to your request and then review  those records to determine which &ndash; and what parts of each &ndash; can be released.  The agency will redact, or black out, any information protected from disclosure  by one of the FOIA&rsquo;s nine exemptions. The releasable records will then be sent  to you.</p>

          <p>There is no initial fee required to submit a  FOIA request, but the FOIA does provide for the charging of certain types of  fees in some instances.</p>
          <p>For a typical requester the agency can charge  for the time it takes to search for records and for duplication of those  records. There is usually no charge for the first two hours of search time or  for the first 100 pages of duplication.</p>
          <p>You may always include in your request letter a  specific statement limiting the amount that you are willing to pay in fees. If  an agency estimates that the total fees for processing your request will exceed  $25, it will notify you in writing of the estimate and offer you an opportunity  to narrow your request in order to reduce the fees. If you agree to pay fees  for a records search, you may be required to pay such fees even if the search  does not locate any releasable records.</p>

Can I ask that any fees be waived?
    </button>
    <div id="b-a11" class="usa-accordion-content">
      <p>You may request a waiver of fees. Under the FOIA,  fee waivers are limited to situations in which a requester can show that the  disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is  likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations  and activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial  interest of the requester. Requests for fee waivers from individuals who are  seeking records on themselves usually do not meet this standard. In  addition, a requester&apos;s inability to pay fees is not a legal basis for granting  a fee waiver.</p>

          <p>Once the agency has processed your request it will send you a written response. This response will let you know whether records were located and will include all releasable documents.  If any portions of the records are withheld, for instance because disclosure would invade an individual&apos;s personal privacy, the agency will inform you of the specific FOIA exemption that is being applied.</p>

          <p>Agencies typically process requests in the order  of receipt.&nbsp; The time it takes to respond  to a request will vary depending on the complexity of the request and any backlog of requests already pending at the agency. &nbsp;A simple request can be processed faster by  the agency than one that is complex.&nbsp;  Simple requests are typically more targeted and seek fewer pages of records.&nbsp; Complex requests typically seek a high volume  of material or require additional steps to process such as the need to search  for records in multiple locations.&nbsp; The  agency&rsquo;s FOIA Requester Service Center is available to assist you with any  question about the status of your request and any steps you can take to receive  a quicker response.</p>

Can I ever have my request processed faster than usual or expedited?
    </button>
    <div id="b-a14" class="usa-accordion-content">
         <p>Under certain conditions you may be entitled to have your request processed on an expedited basis. There are two specific situations where a request will be expedited, which means that it is handled as soon as practicable. These two situations apply to every agency. First, a request will be expedited if the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to someone&apos;s life or physical safety. Second, if there is an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information, his or her request will be expedited. Agencies can also establish addtional standards for granting expedited processing which they describe in their FOIA regulations.</p>

        <p>If you are seeking records on yourself you will  be required to provide a certification of your identity. This certification is  required in order to protect your privacy and to ensure that private  information about you is not disclosed inappropriately to someone else.  Whenever you request information about yourself you will be asked to provide  either a notarized statement or a statement signed under penalty of perjury  stating that you are the person who you say you are.</p>

       <p>Generally, when requesting information about  another person you will receive greater access by submitting authorization from  that individual permitting the disclosure of the records to you, or by  submitting proof that the individual is deceased.&nbsp; If you request records relating to another  person, and disclosure of the records could invade that person&apos;s privacy, they  ordinarily will not be disclosed to you.</p>

		  <p>Not all records are required to be released under the FOIA.  Congress established nine exemptions from disclosure for certain categories of information to protect against certain harms, such as an invasion of personal privacy, or harm to law enforcement investigations.    The FOIA authorizes agencies to withhold information when they reasonably foresee that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of these nine exemptions.  
The nine exemptions are described below.</p>

			<p><strong>Exemption 1: </strong>Information that is classified to protect national security.</p>
			<p><strong>Exemption 2: </strong>Information related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.</p>
			<p><strong>Exemption 3: </strong>Information that is prohibited from disclosure by another federal law.</p>
			<p><strong>Exemption 4: </strong>Trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is confidential or privileged.</p>
			<p><strong>Exemption 5: </strong>Privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the:</p>
			  <ol style="font: 14px Calibri, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                <li>Deliberative Process Privilege (provided the records were created less than 25 years  before the date on which they  were requested)</li>
                <li>Attorney-Work Product Privilege</li>
                <li>Attorney-Client Privilege</li>
			  </ol>
			<p><strong>Exemption 6: </strong>Information that, if disclosed, would invade another individual&apos;s personal privacy.</p>
			<p><strong>Exemption 7: </strong>Information compiled for law enforcement purposes that:</p>
			  <ul style="color:#333; list-style-type:none; font: 14px Calibri, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
				<li>7(A). Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings</li>
				<li>7(B). Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication</li>
				<li>7(C). Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy</li>
				<li>7(D). Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source</li>
				<li>7(E). Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law</li>
				<li>7(F). Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual</li>
			<p><strong>Exemption 8: </strong>Information that concerns the supervision of financial institutions.</p>
			<p><strong>Exemption 9: </strong>Geological information on wells.</p>

What are exclusions?
    </button>
    <div id="b-a18" class="usa-accordion-content">
      <p>Congress has provided special protection in the  FOIA for three narrow categories of law enforcement and national security  records.&nbsp; The provisions protecting those records are known as  &ldquo;exclusions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first exclusion protects the existence of an ongoing  criminal law enforcement investigation when the subject of the investigation is  unaware that it is pending and disclosure could reasonably be expected to  interfere with enforcement proceedings.&nbsp; The second exclusion is limited  to criminal law enforcement agencies and protects the existence of informant  records when the informant&rsquo;s status has not been officially confirmed.&nbsp;  The third exclusion is limited to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and  protects the existence of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or  international terrorism records when the existence of such records is classified.&nbsp;  Records falling within an exclusion are not subject to the requirements of the  FOIA.&nbsp; So, when an office or agency responds to your request, its response  will encompass those records that are subject to the FOIA.</p>

          <p>You may file an administrative appeal if you are  not satisfied with an agency&rsquo;s initial response to your request. &nbsp;Before doing so, however, you may wish to contact  the FOIA professional handling the request or the agency&rsquo;s FOIA Public Liaison.&nbsp;The  FOIA Public Liaison is there to explain the process to you, assist in reducing  any delays, and help resolve any disputes.&nbsp; Often, a simple discussion  between you and the agency will resolve any issues that may arise.</p>
          <p>If necessary, filing an appeal is very simple.  Typically, all you need to do is send a letter or e-mail to the designated appeal authority of the agency stating that you are appealing the initial decision made on your request.  There is no fee or cost involved.  After an independent review, the appellate authority will send you a response advising you of its decision.  Once the administrative appeal process is complete, you also have the option to seek mediation services from the Office of Government Information Services at the National Archives and Records Administration. <a class="" href="glossary.html#o" title="Help - What is OGIS?"><img width="12" height="12" alt="" src="images/question-icon.gif" style="margin: 0 5px;"></a></p>
