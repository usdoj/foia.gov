When a FOIA request presents  “unusual circumstances” as defined by the FOIA, the agency can extend the 20 working-day response time.  Unusual circumstances occur when:  (1) the agency needs to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; (2) the agency needs to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or (3) the agency needs to consult with another agency or two or more components within its own agency.
