term: "Compelling need"
---

A requester may qualify for expedited processing of their FOIA request if they can demonstrate a “compelling need” for the records.  A “compelling need” can be shown  by:  (1) establishing that the  failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis “could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;” or, (2) if the requester is a “person primarily engaged in  disseminating information,” by demonstrating that there exists an “urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.”  Agencies may also establish additional criteria for granting expedited processing, which they describe in their FOIA regulations.
