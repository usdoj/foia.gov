The description of the records you are requesting is important. The scope
of your request can impact how quickly an agency can respond to your
request. Your description should be as clear and specific as possible
and must give agency FOIA personnel enough detail so that they are able 
to reasonably determine exactly which records are being requested and 
where to locate them.
